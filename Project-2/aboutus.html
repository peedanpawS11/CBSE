		PROFILE<br><br>
		&emsp;
		The Group<br><br>
			We are a leading online travel company in India and committed to our mission of “creating happy travelers.” 
			Through our website, our mobile applications and our other associated platforms, leisure and business travelers can explore, 
			research, compare prices and book a wide range of services catering to their travel needs. 
			Since our inception in 2006, more than 4 million customers have used one or more of our comprehensive
			travel-related services, which include domestic and international air ticketing, hotel bookings, homestays,
			holiday packages, bus ticketing, rail ticketing, activities and ancillary services. With over 61,000 hotels contracted
			in over 1,100 cities across India, we are India’s largest platform for domestic hotels.<br>
			The acquisition of companies, intellectual property and talented individuals has been central to our growth strategy.
			In 2010, we acquired TSI and its subsidiaries in order to expand our B2B business, particularly our international air
			ticketing for small and medium scale enterprises. In 2012, we acquired Travelguru B2B and B2C entities from Travelocity,
			which remain well-established hotel aggregators in India. Through this acquisition, we expanded our hotel business by 
			establishing more direct hotel relationships in India and improved our inventory of affordable travel options. 
			We have also leveraged our leading position in the Indian travel ecosystem to make several “acqui-hires”,
			including the teams from mGaadi and dudegenie, in order to grow our business.
